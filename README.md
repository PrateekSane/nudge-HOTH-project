# Nudge - a social self-care app
  
:sparkles:**Best Hack Overall**:sparkles: for UCLA ACM's Hack off the Hill (2021).
  
## Inspiration  
  
Our inspiration for Nudge was the difficulty in keeping up with friends and acquaintances in our outer social circles. For many people, the friends you haven’t caught up with in a while are people you’d love to talk to but don’t have much to talk about. It can be awkward and difficult to bond because you lead very different lives, but one thing we all have in common is the need to take good care of ourselves. What better way to bond than over self-care?
  
## What it does  
  
Our project combines messaging with self-care. It is a social self-care habit tracker that reminds you to send your friends personalized “nudges” to practice good habits and take care of themselves. It also allows you to track your own habits.
  
## How we built it  
  
To build the project, our team split up into two groups. One was focused on the backend and the other was focused on the frontend. For our backend, we used MongoDB, Express.js, and NodeJS. For our front end, we mainly used React Native. Once the backend was finished and the frontend was almost done, we joined forces and focused on connecting both parts.
